## 💱 Currency Exchange Rate Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project aims to predict future currency exchange rates using Support Vector Regression (SVR) — a powerful machine learning model capable of handling nonlinear financial data trends.
It includes an interactive Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to visualize and forecast exchange rate movements over different time periods.

### 📘 Project Overview

The project leverages a historical Forex dataset and applies data preprocessing, feature transformation, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to build an accurate predictive model for currency exchange rates.
Users can interact with a simple graphical interface to visualize predictions for 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month durations.
